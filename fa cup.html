  <li><b>First FA Cup Win: 1909</b></li>
  <li><b>Latest FA Cup Win: 2024</b></li>
  <li><b>Most Successful Manager: Sir Alex Ferguson (5 wins)</b></li>
  </section>
 <h3><b>1908–09: The First Triumph</b></h3>
 <p><b>Under the guidance of Secretary-Manager Ernest Mangnall, United claimed the club's first FA Cup. Captain Charlie Roberts led a determined side to a 1–0 victory over Bristol City at the Crystal Palace stadium. Sandy Turnbull scored the historic winner, securing United's place among English football's elite and laying a foundation for future success.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1947–48: Busby's First Glory</b></h3>
 <p><b>In Matt Busby's first full season as manager, United delivered a thrilling performance at Wembley. Captained by the versatile Johnny Carey, the team overcame Stanley Matthews' Blackpool 4–2 in a classic final. This victory, United's first major trophy in nearly 40 years, announced the beginning of the iconic "Busby Babes" era and signalled the club's post-war resurgence.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1962–63: Rising from the Ashes</b></h3>
 <p><b>Five years after the Munich Air Disaster, Matt Busby completed the club's emotional rebuilding by winning the FA Cup. With Noel Cantwell as captain, United defeated Leicester City 3–1 at Wembley. Two goals from David Herd and one from Denis Law secured the trophy, providing a cathartic moment of triumph and signalling United's return to the pinnacle of the game.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1976–77: Denying the Reds</b></h3>
 <p><b>In a fiery clash against arch-rivals Liverpool, Tommy Docherty's vibrant United side pulled off a memorable upset. Captain Martin Buchan led the team to a 2–1 victory, with goals from Stuart Pearson and Jimmy Greenhoff. The win denied Bob Paisley's Liverpool, who had just won the league, a historic treble, and remains a cherished victory for United fans.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1982–83: The Replay Rout</b></h3>
 <p><b>After a stunning 2–2 draw in which Brighton's Gordon Smith missed a last-minute chance to win it, United needed a replay. Under Ron Atkinson, captain Ray Wilkins inspired a ruthless performance at Wembley. United won 4–0, with teenager Norman Whiteside becoming the youngest-ever scorer in an FA Cup final, cementing his place in club folklore.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1984–85: Whiteside's Wembley Winner</b></h3>
 <p><b>In a tense and physical final against Howard Kendall's excellent Everton side, Ron Atkinson's United triumphed again. Captain Bryan Robson lifted the cup after a 1–0 extra-time victory. The only goal came from Norman Whiteside, who curled a magnificent shot past Neville Southall, showcasing his unique talent for the big occasion.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1989–90: The Save & The Saviour</b></h3>
 <p><b>This final is etched in history as the one that saved Alex Ferguson's tenure. After a dramatic 3–3 draw with Crystal Palace, a replay was required. With captain Bryan Robson injured, goalkeeper Les Sealey and defender Lee Martin became unlikely heroes. Martin's volley secured a 1-0 win, providing the platform for the unprecedented success that would follow.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1993–94: The Double Double</b></h3>
 <p><b>As United powered towards their first league and cup "Double" of the Premier League era, they met Chelsea in the final. Captain Steve Bruce led a dominant display at Wembley. Goals from Eric Cantona (two penalties), Mark Hughes, and Brian McClair sealed a comprehensive 4-0 victory, a statement of supremacy from Sir Alex Ferguson's first great team.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1995–96: The King's Final</b></h3>
 <p><b>In a fiercely contested all-red final against Liverpool, a moment of pure genius decided the match. With the score 0-0 and time running out, United won a corner. The clearance fell to Eric Cantona on the edge of the box, and the Frenchman lashed a sublime volley through a crowded penalty area. Captain Steve Bruce lifted the cup after the 1-0 win, completing a second domestic double.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1998–99: The Treble Season</b></h3>
 <p><b>As part of the unforgettable, historic Treble, United faced Newcastle United at the old Wembley. With Peter Schmeichel captaining the side in Roy Keane's suspension-enforced absence, goals from Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes secured a comfortable 2-0 victory. This was the second leg of the unprecedented Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Champions League triumph.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2003–04: Millwall Masterclass</b></h3>
 <p><b>Held at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley was built, this final was a showcase for United's attacking prowess against First Division Millwall. Captain Roy Keane lifted the trophy after a 3-0 win, with a double from Ruud van Nistelrooy and a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored his first major goal for the club in the process.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2015–16: Lingard's Lightning Strike</b></h3>
 <p><b>Louis van Gaal's tenure culminated in a dramatic FA Cup win. Captain Wayne Rooney orchestrated the play as United fought back from a goal down against Crystal Palace. After Juan Mata's equaliser, the game went to extra time. Just three minutes from a penalty shootout, Jesse Lingard unleashed an unstoppable volley to win the cup 2-1, delivering a memorable farewell for the manager.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2023–24: The Derby Defiance</b></h3>
 <p><b>In the first-ever all-Manchester FA Cup final, United entered as clear underdogs against the dominant Premier League champions. However, under immense pressure, manager Erik ten Hag masterminded a perfect tactical performance. First-half goals from teenagers Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo shocked City. A late City reply created tension, but captain Bruno Fernandes led a resilient defensive effort to secure a famous 2-1 victory, claiming a record-extending 13th FA Cup.</b></p>
