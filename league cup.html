  <p><b>Record in the Competition: Manchester United have a strong historical record in the League Cup, using it to blood young talent and secure silverware across different eras. Their six victories place them joint-top of the all-time winners list alongside Manchester City.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1992 (Milk Cup)</b></h3>
 <p><b>The 1992 Milk Cup final was a landmark moment for Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson. In a tense clash at Wembley against Nottingham Forest, a solitary goal from Brian McClair secured a 1-0 victory. This trophy was pivotal, acting as the first major piece of silverware in Ferguson's reign. It provided tangible proof of progress, silenced doubters, and laid a crucial foundation of winning mentality for the incredible dynasty that would follow throughout the 1990s and beyond.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2006 (Carling Cup)</b></h3>
 <p><b>A dominant performance at the Millennium Stadium showcased the new generation of United stars. Facing Wigan Athletic, a vibrant United side featuring the burgeoning talents of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo ran out emphatic 4-0 winners, with Rooney netting twice. This Carling Cup win signaled that Sir Alex Ferguson had successfully rebuilt his team, blending experienced winners like Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs with explosive young talent, setting the stage for another period of domestic and European dominance.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2009 (Carling Cup)</b></h3>
 <p><b>In a tight, goalless final against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, United's nerve held firm in a penalty shootout. After a 0-0 draw, United's spot-kicks were flawless, winning 4-1. This victory was characteristic of the relentless trophy-gathering machine Ferguson had built. It was part of a season where United also won the Premier League and reached the Champions League final, underlining their status as a powerhouse capable of challenging on all fronts.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2010 (Carling Cup)</b></h3>
 <p><b>Manchester United successfully defended the trophy in dramatic fashion against Aston Villa. Michael Owen put United ahead with a classic poacher's goal, but Villa equalized late on. The final was decided by a powerful header from Wayne Rooney in the 74th minute, securing a 2-1 win. This second consecutive League Cup triumph highlighted the squad's depth and resilience, and it was a fitting contribution from Rooney, who was in the form of his life during the 2009-10 season..</b></p>
 <h3><b>2017 (EFL Cup)</b></h3>
 <p><b>The first major trophy of the post-Ferguson era arrived in a thrilling final under José Mourinho. United took a 2-0 lead against Southampton through a Zlatan Ibrahimović free-kick and a Jesse Lingard strike, only for the Saints to fight back to 2-2. With the game heading for extra time, the iconic Ibrahimović rose to power in an 87th-minute header, sealing a dramatic 3-2 victory. This EFL Cup broke a relative trophy drought and provided the platform for a season where United would also win the Europa League.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2023 (Carabao Cup)</b></h3>
 <p><b>Ending a six-year wait for silverware, Erik ten Hag's new-look United delivered a controlled and confident performance at Wembley against Newcastle United. A towering first-half header from Casemiro settled nerves, before a Marcus Rashford shot was deflected in by Sven Botman for the second. The 2-0 win was a testament to Ten Hag's immediate impact, instilling discipline, a clear style of play, and a winning mentality. It marked the dawn of a new era and validated the club's project under the Dutch manager.</b></p>
