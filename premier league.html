 <h2><b>List of Premier League Title Wins</b></h2>
 <h3><b>1992–93</b></h3>
 <p><b>Under the guidance of Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United captured the inaugural Premier League title, ending a 26-year wait for the top-flight championship. The transformative mid-season signing of Eric Cantona provided the flair and assurance needed, combining with the grit of Mark Hughes and the commanding presence of goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel to secure the historic victory.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1993–94</b></h3>
 <p><b>United powerfully defended their crown, completing a famous "Double Double" by winning the Premier League and FA Cup for the second consecutive season. Inspired once more by Eric Cantona, and bolstered by the arrival of a fierce young midfielder in Roy Keane, the team amassed a formidable 92 points, showcasing both style and relentless consistency.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1995–96</b></h3>
 <p><b>This season is immortalized for one of the greatest comebacks in English football history. Trailing Kevin Keegan's Newcastle United by 12 points, a maturing "Class of '92" featuring David Beckham and Gary Neville, led by the returning Eric Cantona, produced a stunning run of form to overtake their rivals and clinch a dramatic second league and FA Cup double.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1996–97</b></h3>
 <p><b>With a squad now brimming with youthful talent from the academy, United retained the title, confirming the dawn of a new era. While Eric Cantona remained the talisman in his final season, the growing influence of David Beckham and the prolific partnership of Andy Cole and Ole Gunnar Solskjær pointed to a bright future for Ferguson's evolving team.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1998–99</b></h3>
 <p><b>The pinnacle of the club's history. In a season of relentless drama and last-gasp victories, United secured an unprecedented English Treble. While the Champions League and FA Cup finals provided legendary moments, the foundation was a hard-fought Premier League title, won with crucial contributions from captain Roy Keane, the evergreen Ryan Giggs, and a formidable team spirit.</b></p>
 <h3><b>1999–00</b></h3>
 <p><b>Fresh from their Treble triumph, United dominated the league like never before. Winning the title by a then-record margin of 18 points, they displayed a ruthless hunger for more success. The attacking trio of Dwight Yorke, Andy Cole, and the emerging talents of Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs proved too potent for any challenger to handle.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2000–01</b></h3>
 <p><b>United secured a third consecutive championship—a "three-peat"—for the second time under Ferguson, underlining their era-defining dominance. The season was marked by the arrival of a new goalscoring sensation, Ruud van Nistelrooy, whose prolific form ensured the team maintained its grip on English football's top prize.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2002–03</b></h3>
 <p><b>After surrendering the title to Arsenal the previous year, United mounted a fierce challenge to reclaim it. A titanic battle with Arsène Wenger's "Invincibles" saw United overtake their rivals in the final months, powered by the goals of Ruud van Nistelrooy and the leadership of new defensive stalwart Rio Ferdinand.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2006–07</b></h3>
 <p><b>Following a three-year hiatus while Chelsea rose to power, United stormed back to the summit. The maturing of Cristiano Ronaldo into a world-class force, combined with the guile of Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes, propelled them to the title. The signing of Michael Carrick provided crucial balance in midfield, signaling a return to the top.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2007–08</b></h3>
 <p><b>A season of breathtaking attacking football culminated in a prestigious Double. United clinched the Premier League title in a tight race before winning the UEFA Champions League in Moscow. Cristiano Ronaldo was unstoppable, scoring a remarkable 31 league goals, while the defensive partnership of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidić became the bedrock of success.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2008–09</b></h3>
 <p><b>United matched Liverpool's long-standing record of 18 English top-flight titles with a third consecutive championship. Despite the continued brilliance of Cristiano Ronaldo, this triumph was built on a formidable defense, with Nemanja Vidić named Player of the Season, and crucial goals from Wayne Rooney and the evergreen Ryan Giggs.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2010–11</b></h3>
 <p><b>United won a record 19th English league title, finally surpassing Liverpool's historic tally. A relatively unheralded but supremely effective squad, marshaled by the rock-solid Nemanja Vidić and inspired by Wayne Rooney, secured the championship with a game to spare, writing a new chapter in the club's storied history.</b></p>
 <h3><b>2012–13</b></h3>
 <p><b>In the final, glorious act of Sir Alex Ferguson's managerial career, United won the title in commanding fashion. The signing of Robin van Persie from rivals Arsenal proved decisive, with the Dutchman's hat-trick against Aston Villa in April symbolically sealing the championship. It was a fitting farewell, securing the club's 20th top-flight crown and 13th Premier League trophy.</b></p>
