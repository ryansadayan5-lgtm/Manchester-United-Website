 <p><b>The Stretford End is not just a stand; it is the beating heart, the vocal soul, and the defining symbol of Manchester United’s home ground, Old Trafford. For over a century, it has been the fortress of the club’s most passionate supporters, generating an atmosphere that has inspired legends and intimidated opponents. Located at the west end of the stadium, it is the goal United attacks in the second half, a tradition infused with hope and history.</b></p>

 <h3><b>History and Evolution</b></h3>
 <p><b>The stand’s origins date back to the early 20th century. The original, massive terraced Stretford End was a vast, swaying sea of humanity, famed for its noise and loyalty. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s as part of the post-Taylor Report stadium modernization, becoming a two-tiered all-seater stand. The current Stretford End houses over 20,000 fans, comprising Tier 1 (lower) and Tier 2 (upper). Despite the move to seating, its character and reputation as the epicenter of vocal support remain utterly intact.</b></p>
